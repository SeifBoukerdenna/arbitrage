# PythonApp

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to enhance my skills in Python programming, gain a better understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and explore my passion for statistics and probabilities.

## Objectives

- Improve Python programming skills.
- Deepen understanding of OOP concepts.
- Apply statistical and probabilistic methods in practical scenarios.

## Motivation

This project is driven by my desire to become proficient in Python, master OOP principles, and leverage statistical techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Structure

The project will be organized into modules focusing on different aspects of Python, OOP, and statistics.

## Functionality

This project provides a comprehensive betting strategy tool with the following features:

### User Behavior Analysis

- **Behavior Types**: Categorizes users into aggressive, normal, and passive based on their betting patterns.
- **Behavior Tracking**: Continuously monitors and updates user behavior to refine strategies.

### Odds and Confidence Integration

- **Odds Calculation**: Computes the odds for each bet using statistical models.
- **Confidence Levels**: Incorporates user confidence levels to adjust betting recommendations.

### Betting Strategy Recommendations

- **Combination Generator**: Suggests various betting combinations tailored to user behavior and odds.
- **Bet Allocation**: Recommends the amount to bet on each combination to maximize potential returns.

### Import/Export Strategies

- **Import Functionality**: Allows users to import previous betting data to refine strategies.
- **Export Functionality**: Enables users to export their betting strategies for future reference or analysis.

### Advanced Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes and improve betting strategies.
- **Real-time Updates**: Provides real-time updates on odds and betting recommendations based on live data.

## Future Plans
